Hi All,

Another new chart by which I got impressed and gave a try.

This is Likert chart especially for dataset in Likert manner.

I used Imaginary Restaurant review data and made a detailed crosstab along with the likert chart which shows the review of major categories in a restaurant.

For little edge to find null hypothesis, also detailed the analysis by considering the gender.

Have fun and happy coding.
